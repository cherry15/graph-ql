# Getting Started with Learn Apollo GraphQL
The purpose of this app is to learn the basics of graphQL server and client. It is based on the tutorial at 
https://odyssey.apollographql.com/lift-off-part1/feature-overview-and-setup parts 1, 2 and 3. 
It also uses create react app and react router. I have re-written the FE to typescript and have simplified the styles.
The images are huge but as image compression isn't the goal of this exercise I've left them huge.

In the client folder you can run
### `npm install && npm start`

In the server folder you can run
### `npm install && npm start`
